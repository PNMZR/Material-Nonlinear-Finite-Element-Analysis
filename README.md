# Python3_FEM_Codes_Recomposed_from_Other_Programming_Languages

In this repository, I try to use **Python3** to rewrite **FEM codes** of other programming languages, like Matlab, C++, Fortran, aimming at learning and praticing FEM programming.

## FEM Codes of Other Programming Languages

* The Matlab codes of chapters 1, 2 and 4 from book titled [Introduction to Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-1746-1#about) by Nam-Ho Kim.

* The Matlab codes from book titled [The Finite Element Method Using MATLAB (2ed)](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/books/the-finite-element-method-using-matlab-kwon.html?s_tid=books-seo-redirect) by Young Kwon and Hyochoong Bang.

* The Matlab codes from  master thesis titled [MATLAB FEM Code - From Elasticity to Plasticity](http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b187/ce0bbf1efdd4bcf314de76644765efe5d092.pdf) by Sherif, Feysel Nesru.
